# ISSR Data Management in R 2016

## Overview

This Git repo contains all materials necessary for this ISSR Data Management in R Workshop. You can email me at <mdenny@psu.edu> or <matthewjdenny@gmail.com> with any questions. There are lots of materials available on my website at: <http://www.mjdenny.com/teaching.html>. To download the materials you see here, you will want to start by downloading a GUI client for Git. 

* For Windows: <https://windows.github.com/>
* For Mac: <https://mac.github.com/>
* For Linux, you may have to rely on the command line, although <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis> has some options (depending on your distro).

You will then want to `clone` this repo onto your computer using either the 

    https://github.com/matthewjdenny/ISSR_Data_Management_in_R_2016.git

link and your client or by clicking the "Clone in Desktop" button on the right hand side of the page. If you want to directly edit the files posted here and track your changes, you can copy individual files into another directory and create your own repo with the files in it.  We will go over using Github on the first morning of the workshop, so there is no need to spend too much time trying to figure Github out.

## Schedule

This is a draft outline of the workshop schedule, it will likely change over the course of the workshop depending on how fast we end up going.

### Before the workshop

Please download R and RStudio before the workshop, and if you have never used R before, you may want to look through some of the introductory examples listed below 

* Download R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

* This section of Quick R provides a basic overview of the R interface. You can navigate between pages by clicking on the links on the top left -- <http://www.statmethods.net/interface/index.html>
* A nice place to start learning R interactively is [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/).
