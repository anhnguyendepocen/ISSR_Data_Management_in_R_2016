# In this script, I will provide several examples and seek to introduce you to
# the kinds of things one should always do to produce really clean plots for
# publication. I cannot possibly hope to cover every siutation, but I always
# find myself doing the same sorts of things whenever I make plots for
# publication. This is really where R shines. We will be using the base R
# graphics and ggplot2.

# install ggplot2
# install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = TRUE)
